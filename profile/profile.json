The LCA team would use this information for real-time resource monitoring as well as planning how to allocate these resources in the future. The specifications and usage statistics are collected using bash scripts and stored in a PostgreSQL database which runs in a Docker container. Usage statistics are gathered every minute and inserted into the database with timestamps.",
