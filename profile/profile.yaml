    description: This project implements a few utilities designed to help the Jarvis Cluster Administration (LCA) team collect system specifications as well as resource usage from each node running on their Linux cluster. The LCA team would use this information for real-time resource monitoring as well as planning how to allocate these resources in the future. The specifications and usage statistics are collected using bash scripts and stored in a PostgreSQL database which runs in a Docker container. Usage statistics are gathered every minute and inserted into the database with timestamps.
