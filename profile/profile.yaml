summary: I am a dedicated and results driven software developer who is always looking to learn more and use my skills to build real world solutions. Having graduated from York University with a first class degree in computer science, I am now looking for opportunities to apply my theoretical knowledge to create practical software solutions. Through my academic journey and personal projects, I have equipped myself with a wide array of software tools. I am skilled in Java, Python, REST APIs, SQL, with experience in React and NodeJS. I am currently working at Jarvis where I am utilizing technologies including Docker, Java, SQL, and many more on a wide array of projects. My current position has also provided me with experience working under the Scrum/Agile framework. I believe my skillset allows me to excel in any development environment.

    description: This project implements a few utilities designed to help the Jarvis Cluster Administration (LCA) team collect system specifications as well as resource usage from each node running on their Linux cluster. The LCA team would use this information for real-time resource monitoring as well as planning how to allocate these resources in the future. The specifications and usage statistics are collected using bash scripts and stored in a PostgreSQL database which runs in a Docker container. Usage statistics are gathered every minute and inserted into the database with timestamps.
