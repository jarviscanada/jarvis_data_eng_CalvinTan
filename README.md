# Calvin Tan . Jarvis Consulting

I am a dedicated and results driven software developer who is always looking to learn more and use my skills to build real world solutions. Having graduated from York University with a first class degree in computer science, I am now looking for opportunities to apply my theoretical knowledge to create practical software solutions. Through my academic journey and personal projects, I have equipped myself with a wide array of software tools. I am skilled in Java, Python, REST APIs, SQL, with experience in React and NodeJS. I am currently working at Jarvis where I am utilizing technologies including Docker, Java, SQL, and many more on a wide array of projects. My current position has also provided me with experience working under the Scrum/Agile framework. I believe my skillset allows me to excel in any development environment.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_CalvinTan](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_CalvinTan)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_CalvinTan/tree/master/linux_sql)]: This project implements a few utilities designed to help the Jarvis Cluster Administration (LCA) team collect system specifications as well as resource usage from each node running on their Linux cluster. The LCA team would use this information for real-time resource monitoring as well as planning how to allocate these resources in the future. The specifications and usage statistics are collected using bash scripts and stored in a PostgreSQL database which runs in a Docker container. Usage statistics are gathered every minute and inserted into the database with timestamps.


## Highlighted Projects
**Port Scanner**: Built a tool in Java that is capable of scanning for open ports from a given IP address. Utilizing Java's multithreading feature, up to 10,000 ports in parallel for highly optimized performance. Implements a REST API using Spring Boot to allow the tool to be accessed from any web browser.

**Windows Power Plan Tool**: Designed and implemented a system tray tool to allow users to easily swap between different power plans on a Windows device. The tool executes batch files to access the PC's power plan controls. A GUI built using Windows Forms allows users to see the current power plan at a glance and change it through the system tray icon.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2020-present)**: Developed a cluster management solution for the Linux Cluster Administration team utilizing bash scripts, Docker, and PostgreSQL. Designed, created, and maintained an efficient and robust database

**PASS Leader, York University (2020)**: Organized and facilitated two 90 minute study sessions to assist students with difficulties in PHYS1800 (Engineering Mechanics). Prior to each session, lectures would be attended to keep up with the specific material students were learning. Learning material would then be produced based on the lecture content to be tackled as a group during PASS sessions. Before midterms and finals, mock tests and exams were hosted to help students feel more prepared.
